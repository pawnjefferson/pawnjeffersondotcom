So I pulled out my old blog and changed a few things around and .... here we are!</p>
    <p>So far these have been the places I have been on my trip: <ul><li>San Diego<li>Las Vegas<li>Cedar City, Utah<li>Salt Lake City<li>Denver<li>Omaha, Nebraska<li>Chicago<li>Fort Lauderdale<li>and now back in Chicago</ul>`

    title: `Yesterday I drove from Destin, Florida to St. Petersburg, Florida.  Phew that was another longgg drive.  Also said what's up on my way down to my friends in Hernando Beach at their place right on the Gulf of Mexico.  Fun times playing Chess and trying to get them to finally take me time traveling with them.  Today I recorded grand piano and some authentic wurlitzer electric piano tracks for my latest three songs.  Can't wait to share them.  They sound fire.  Speaking of flame I got some fireeee.  Let's go LEAS this week.  Stay tuned for more quality content!!!`,

    title: `Today I went to the beach and went for a quick swim, but there was nobody there and there were absolutely 0 waves so I soon left.  Then I went to LA Fitness where they had a basketball court.  I played with some younger people - ages 14, 18, 23, 25 - and the first game I won, second game someone else won, and then the third game we were playing 21 (first to 21).  I had 8 points and there were other people with 13, 15 and 16 points.  I came back and won it!!  You should have seen how mad they were.  I gave them good game bro fives and the oldest one gave me a bad bro five so I said "that was a bad high five" and the other guy cracked up.  Anyway now I am just chilling waiting for $LEAS to hit and watching Netflix - just finished the first and only season of "I Thing You Should Leave" this is some real oddball comedy that has got me inspired for some Pawn YouTube.`,
