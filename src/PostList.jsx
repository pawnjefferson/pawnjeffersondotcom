I thought with all the adventures I have been on, it would be a good idea to make a way to blog all the crazy exciting things that go in during my travels.  So I pulled out my old blog and changed a few things around and .... here we are!</p>
    <p>So far these have been the places I have been on my trip: <ul><li>San Diego<li>Las Vegas<li>Ceder City, Utah<li>Salt Lake City<li>Denver<li>Omaha, Nebraska<li>Chicago<li>Fort Lauderdale<li>and now back in Chicago</ul>`
