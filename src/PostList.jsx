    html: `<p>Hey Pawn bros!  Welcome to the new website - pawnjefferson.com!  I thought with all the adventures I have been on, it would be a good idea to make a way to blog all the crazy exciting things that go in during my travels.  So I pulled out my old blog and changed a few things around and .... here we are!</p>
    <p>So far these have been the places I have been on my trip: <ul><li>San Diego<li>Las Vegas<li>Ceder City, Utah<li>Salt Lake City<li>Denver<li>Omaha, Nebraska<li>Chicago<li>Fort Lauderdale<li>and now back in Chicago</ul>`

    html: `<p>I hadn't played piano in months, and my voice was a little rusty, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  Makes me want to do more open mics on my travels...</p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CUEgqtwRaMs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>Also!!!!  Just decided on my next two locations: Nashville, TN for one week and then Destin, FL for one week.  Heard really good things about Destin.<p>Alsoooooo this website is a work in progress.  I'd really like to be able to add polls and receive comments and such so you can interact with your man, PAWN JEFFERSONNNNNNN.  Shout out to the haterz!`
